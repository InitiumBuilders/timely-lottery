## Built on Dash Platform 🔵

Timely.Works doesn't just *use* Dash for payments. It publishes lottery data — results, entries, outcomes — to **Dash Drive**, a decentralized data layer built into the Dash blockchain.

Every lottery is a document on-chain. Signed. Permanent. Verifiable by anyone, without trusting Timely.Works.

```
GET /api/platform/verify?lotteryId=YOUR_LOTTERY_ID
→ { "onChain": true, "docs": { "lottery": {...}, "result": {...}, "entries": [...] } }
```

- **Data Contract** defines the schema (`platform/contracts/lottery-contract.json`)
- **Dual-write** — SQLite for speed, Dash Drive for truth
- **Graceful degradation** — app works without `TIMELY_CONTRACT_ID` set
- **No PII on-chain** — only public DPNS names, ticket counts, initium titles

## What Is This?

Timely.Works is a **DASH-powered community lottery** where:

- 🎟 **Anyone** can buy tickets by sending $DASH
- 💡 **Anyone** can submit an Initium (an idea worth funding)
- 🤖 **AI auto-starts** each new lottery with a poetic, culture-connected name
- 🏆 **One winner** takes 85% — transparent, on-chain, verifiable
- 🏦 **10%** goes to the Reserve fund · **5%** seeds the next lottery
- 🔑 **Login with your `.dash` username** via Dash Platform (DPNS)

No middlemen. No admin required. The platform runs itself.

## Built on Dash Evolution

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **DPNS** | Username login — `august.dash` signs in without a password |
| **DAPI** | Decentralized API — no centralized RPC node needed |
| **dashcore-lib** | HD wallet derivation — unique address per lottery |
| **Data Contracts** | On-chain lottery + result storage (Phase 2 roadmap) |
| **Dash Core** | Fast payments — every split broadcast on-chain |

## How Auto Admin Works

The background worker (`scripts/worker.mjs`) runs every 5 seconds and:

1. **Scans** all entry deposit addresses for new DASH
2. **Detects** expired lotteries → auto-ends + pays out winner
3. **Checks** for lottery gap → if none active + Auto Admin enabled → starts new one
4. **Calls** OpenAI to generate a timely, creative name for the new round
5. **Derives** a fresh deposit address from the HD wallet
6. **Seeds** the new lottery with any reserve next-lottery funds

All of this happens **autonomously**. No human needed.

## The Payout System

```
Total DASH collected
       │
       ├── 85% ──→ Winner's DASH address  (on-chain TX)
       ├── 10% ──→ Reserve fund address   (community treasury)
       └──  5% ──→ Next lottery address   (seeds next round)
```

Every split is a real blockchain transaction. Every TX ID is shown publicly. Every payout is verifiable on [insight.dash.org](https://insight.dash.org).

- Identity-based ticket ownership
- Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for provably fair draws
- Multi-sig payout using Platform identity keys

### 🔲 Phase 4 (Expansion)
- Native mobile app (DashPay integration)
- Cross-lottery reputation on Platform
- Dash DAO proposal for treasury support
- `@timely/lottery-sdk` — deploy your own instance

## Deploying to VPS

```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Start with PM2 (ecosystem config handles env vars)
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Save PM2 process list
pm2 save
pm2 startup

# Check status
pm2 status
pm2 logs timely-worker --lines 50
```

The Vercel project proxies API calls to your VPS. Set `WORKER_URL` to your VPS address in both `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables.
